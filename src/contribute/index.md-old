## General contribution guidelines

We prefer the contributions to be made via [GitHub][github].

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account,
    you can [send us comments by email][contact].
    However,
    we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    In Stencila we follow a commonly used workflow
    for [contributing to open source projects][how-contribute]
    (see also [GitHub instructions][github-flow]).

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE).
Everyone involved with Stencila agrees to abide by our [code of conduct][conduct].
