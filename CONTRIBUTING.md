# Contributing to Stencila

*The contribution guidelines are based on the guidelines provided by [Software and Data Carpentry](http://carpentries.org).*

[Stencila][stencila-site] is an open-source community-driven project. We encourage
and welcome contributions from all community members. You can contribute to a
whole variety of Stencila components and in many different ways: from
contributing new source code and documentation, to providing feedback on
Stencila and making suggestions for improvements.

## Licensing and contributor agreement

By contributing,
you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE).
Everyone involved with Stencila
agrees to abide by our [code of conduct][conduct].


## General contribution guidelines

We prefer the contributions to be made via [GitHub][github].

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account,
    you can [send us comments by email][contact].
    However,
    we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    In Stencila we follow a commonly used workflow
    for [contributing to open source projects][how-contribute].
