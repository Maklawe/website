  <div class="summary">In this post, I'm going to look at the models for data driven content used in popular tools for reproducible documents, RMarkdown and Jupyter. We'll then look at how to extend those models to documents that generate content in more than one execution context. I'll then wrap up with an explanation of the model that I've arrived at as being the best fit for Stencila.</div>

  <div class="summary">Your own dog food can be hard to swallow sometimes. Particularly when you have just finished the strenuous task of pulling yourself up by your own boot straps. Our new blog uses Markdown and is published on Github pages. We're still eating our own dog food by using our Node.js package and by using our new document editor to author posts. But we're hoping that with this new approach there will be less friction in getting posts written and on to the web.</div>

  <div class="summary">Spreadsheets are reactive programming environments that are usually only interacted with via a visual grid interface. For most other programming environments, the primary interface is a text file format specifically designed for humans. In contrast, spreadsheet file formats have been designed for machines, not humans. This post proposes a human friendly format for spreadsheets that can be used as an alternative interface for viewing and editing spreadsheets.</div>

  <div class="summary">In 1979, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston created VisiCalc the world's first spreadsheet software. VisiCalc was an immediate success, became the Apple II's "killer app" and was credited by Steve Jobs with propelling the first explosion in personal computing. Ted Nelson, an internet pioneer, described the paradigm shift that the spreadsheet interface created...</div>
